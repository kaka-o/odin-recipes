    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Instant Pot Taco Soup is one of the easiest soups to make. This is a variation on an old family favorite. I adapted this to be a pressure cooker taco soup. It's delicious and zesty!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>-2 lbs Ground Beef or Ground Turkey (93% lean) use a little oil for browning turkey</li>
            <li>1 packet Taco Seasoning Mix, about 3 Tbsp.</li>
            <li>1 tsp Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>½ tsp Onion Powder</li>
            <li>½ tsp Oregano</li>
            <li>½ tsp Salt</li>
            <li>½ tsp Pepper</li>
            <li>1 packet Ranch Dressing Mix (optional)</li>
            <li>1 (10 oz) can Rotel</li>
            <li>1 (7 oz) can Diced Green Chiles, With juice</li>
            <li>4 cups Chicken Broth, low sodium</li>
            <li>1 (14 oz) can Black Beans, rinsed & drained</li>
            <li>1 (14 oz) can Garbanzo Beans, rinsed & drained</li>
            <li>1 (14 oz) can Red Kidney or Pinto Beans, rinsed & drained</li>
            <li>1 (14 oz) can Diced Tomatoes, with juice</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Turn the pressure cooker on to the Sauté setting. Add the meat (add a little oil if using turkey). Cook for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the taco seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, salt, and pepper. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until meat is cooked.</li>
        <li>Add the Ranch packet, if using, Rotel, green chiles, and chicken broth. Stir, and place a glass lid on the pot to help the broth heat up faster. Once the broth is at a slow simmer, add all of the beans and stir well.</li>
        <li>Add the can of diced tomatoes, but don't stir. Place the lid on the pot and lock in place. Turn the steam release knob to the Sealing position.</li>
        <li>Cancel the Sauté setting and then press the Pressure Cook/Manual button (or dial) and the + or - button (or dial) to choose 6 minutes. The pot will take several minutes to build up the pressure before the timer starts.</li>
        <li>When the cooking cycle has finished, let the pot sit undisturbed for 15 minutes. Then do a controlled Quick Release of the pressure by turning the knob towards the Venting position in short bursts (I use a wooden spoon handle). When you feel confident that no soup will spew out with the steam, open the knob all the way.</li>
        <li>When the pin in the lid drops down, you can open the lid facing away from you. Give the soup a stir, carefully as there could be some hot steam pockets in there.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust salt, if needed, then add the tortillas and the corn. Stir well and let sit for a few minutes, stirring occasionally to help dissolve some of the tortillas.</li>
        <li>Serve with any of the garnishes you like!</li>
        </ol>
